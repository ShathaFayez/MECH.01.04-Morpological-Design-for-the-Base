# MECH.01.04-Morpological-Design-for-the-Base
In this task I did 3 morphological designs for the base of the robotic arm, and I designed the one which I believe is the best for this robot. I designed this one due to many reasons taking into consideration the performance and speed, centre of gravity, and installation.
